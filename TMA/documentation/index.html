			<h3>Intro</h3>

				This is the documentation for the 2014/2015 Birkbeck University of
				London TMA (Tutor Marked Assignment).

			<h3>The validation</h3>

			<p>
				The picture below illustrates that the files provided for this
				assignment are well formed and have passed both DTD and Schema
				validations.

			<h3>The XML design</h3>

			<p>
				The task for this assignment involved creating an address book that
				captures contacts data in an XML format. The XML file must contain at
				least 10 different contacts and should capture at the very least the
				following information:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					The name of the individual or organisation: in the case of a person,
					capture the first name and surname.
				</li>
				<li>
					The full address of the individual or organisation.
				</li>
				<li>
					Telephone details: home, work, fax and mobile for individuals and
					phone and/or fax for organisations.
				</li>
				<li>
					The email address of the person or main contact in the organisation.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				First and foremost, in addition to the items mentioned above, the final
				XML document also features the following elements:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					contact: a repeatable container that holds all the information for a
					single contact
				</li>
				<li>
					person: an element that holds all the unique information common only
					to a person
				</li>
				<li>
					company: an element that holds all the unique information common only
					to a company
				</li>
				<li>line1: added to compliment and better describe an address</li>
				<li>line2: added to compliment and better describe an address</li>
				<li>line3: added to compliment and better describe an address</li>
				<li>postalcode: added to compliment and better describe an address</li>
				<li>city: added to compliment and better describe an address</li>
				<li>country: added to compliment and better describe an address</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The first round of though was placed on grouping which elements are
				present only in a company, which elements are present only in a person
				and which elements are present in both.
			</p>

			<p>
				It was decied that both company and person would have an address and
				a contact email. The unique elements for a person and a company where
				then grouped inside the 'person' and 'company' elements respectively.
			</p>

			<p>
				The only suitable data type for all simple elements was string,
				named string under the Schema and #PCDATA under the DTD.
			</p>

			<p>
				The final step was to apply the business rules, naming which elements
				where allowed to repeat and which ones were not mandatory, the following
				list explain those:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					contact: this is a repeatable element, this element can be repeated as
					many times as there are contacts.
				</li>
				<li>
					person and company: within a contact, there can only be either one
					person or one company
				</li>
				<li>fax: within a company, a fax number is not mandatory</li>
				<li>
					line2 and line3: those elements are not mandatory and only seen as
					complimentary to the other more important elements under address
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Problems encountered</h3>

		<p>
			Although this assignment is rather simplistic, the final outcome of the
			XML document does not make any use of namespaces, the reason behind this
			decision comes from the fact that I could not get the XML Schema to
			validate an XML namespaced tag.
		</p>

		<p>
			This assignment had three repeating element names that had to be ajusted,
			in order to correctly validate the documents without repetition. Those
			element names were, 'telephone', 'fax' and 'name', both appeared under
			'company' and 'person'. In order to work around this problem, all
			telephone numbers under 'person' received a prefix named 'telephone'
			followed by the type name. In addition, a persons 'name' was updated to
			'firstname' and 'surname' to 'lastname' for consistency.

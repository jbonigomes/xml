			<h3>The XML design</h3>

			<p>
				The task for this assignment involved creating a juices catalogue that
				captures juices information in an XML format. The XML file must contain
				at least 10 different contacts and should capture at the very least the
				following information:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The product name, that is, the name of the juice.</li>
				<li>The ingredients for the given product.</li>
				<li>
					Juices and fruit information for the given product, that is, it must
					fullfill the following sub-categories:
					<ul>
						<li>Blend</li>
						<li>Concentrate</li>
						<li>A list of Vitamins present in the product</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Nutricional values for the given product, that is, it must fullfill
					the following sub-categories:
					<ul>
						<li>Energy (kJ)</li>
						<li>Energy (kcal)</li>
						<li>Carbohydrate (g)</li>
						<li>of which Sugars (g)</li>
						<li>Salt (g)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>And the price</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				First and foremost, in addition to the items mentioned above, the final
				XML document also features the following elements:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>juices:</b> a container acting as the root element for the XML
					structure.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>type:</b> a repeatable container that holds all the information
					for a group of juices, this element also features a unique id in order
					to make it easy to identify within the application implementation.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>juice:</b> although not explicitly mentioned in the assignment,
					this container is mandatory in order to hold the details for a single
					product. In addition, this element also features an unique id, so that
					pictures uploaded into the website can link back to each product.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>description:</b> this was added in order to add a more friendly
					description for each product.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The structure of the XML was implemented with the fact that users can
				add as many ingredients to a product as they wish, therefore, the
				structure for ingredients has been declared as a complex type with an 
				unbounded amount of ingredient elements. Likewise, the vitamins element
				follows the same structure. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The datatype used to validate most elements was token, this was decided
				for two reasons, most entries were textual and it removes leading and
				trailing spaces. The price field received a decimal datatype with a
				restriction of 2 fraction digits. All the other numeric entries were
				declared as integers. The following Stack Overflow post was used as a
				base for this declaration:
			</p>

			<p>
				<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6454256">
					http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6454256
				</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				The only other restriction added was to the concentrate element, since
				the value may only either be 'Yes' or 'No', the following W3C schools
				article was used as a base for this declaration:

			<p>
				<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/schema/schema_facets.asp">
					http://www.w3schools.com/schema/schema_facets.asp
				</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				The final business rule to be met, was to ensure that the ids for both
				'juice' and 'type' were kept unique, the following Stack Overflow post
				has served as a based for those declarations:

			<h3>The XML transformation</h3>

			<p>
				This assignment required an implementation of an XSLT transformation of
				the XML into HTML, so that it could be presented as a web page.
			</p>

			<p>
				This was achieved based on the initial files given for the assignment,
				two pages were removed and merged into one, the fruitjuces.html and the
				juices.html. The latter is simply an information page and the former has
				been replaced with the dynamic XML content.
			</p>

			<p>
				To achieve it, an XSLT file was created, the XML links to this file and
				when accessed via a web brower, the transformation occurs.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to the 10 mandatory juices required, the implementation
				created another 5 juices, so that each juice type can now have 3
				products for better demonstration of the capabilities of the final
				outcome.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since there is only one XML file, some JavaScript had to be implemented
				in order to create the illusion that the juices page consists of many
				sub pages grouped by their types.
			</p>

			<p>
				What the JavaScript file does is rather simple, the DOM contains many
				right columns, that are hidden by default, except the first one, when
				the page loads. Since the first right column is simply a static
				introduction which is not related to any juice type, the left navigation
				is left without any 'current page' indication. What it then does is
				simply listen to click events in each of the links in the left
				navigation, when they are clicked, it ensures the right clicked element
				highlights as the current page and displays the relevant right column
				content.
			</p>

			<p>
				The screenshots below illustrate how the final implemention outputs the
				XML content:

			<h3>Problems encountered</h3>

			<p>
				Although this assignment is rather simplistic, the final outcome of the
				XML document does not make any use of namespaces, the reason behind this
				decision comes from the fact that I could not get the XML Schema to
				validate an XML namespaced tag. To overcome this problem, the element
				which contains the name of a type has been renamed from 'name' to
				'title', this way, the element name for a juice could be kept as 'name'.
			</p>

			<p>
				For the JavaScript to display the correct pages, an unique id attribute
				had to be added to the XML Schema, this id is referenced in two places,
				in the XSLT file, once as a data attribute for the left navigation links
				and once as part of the id of each dynamic right column content, so that
				the correct ones can be displayed.
			</p>

			<p>
				The following Stack Overflow post has helped me with concatenating
				values in an XSL attribute:
